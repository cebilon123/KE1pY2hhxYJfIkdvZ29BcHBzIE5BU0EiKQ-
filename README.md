V. 1.18.3

# Build

There is a `Dockerfile` as well as `docker-compose.yml`.

Both are working, but docker-compose is configured to easily set up the application. It is using "DEMO_KEY" as a `API_KEY`, so change it to your
personal one, or leave it for 50 requests.

if you want to change port, just modify port maping in compose, not the env variable.
